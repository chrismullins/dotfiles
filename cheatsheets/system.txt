# On boot, check the network status
  $ systemctl status dhcpcd@wlp0s20f3
# This should be enabled and running
# If it is, access the network by start wpa_supplicant on the same interface
  $ systemctl start wpa_supplicant@wlp0s20f3

# To get right monitor rotated correctly:
# View monitors with
  $ xrandr --query
# Then once you've chosen the one to rotate:
  $ xrandr --output DP-2 --rotate left

# Connect to NordVPN!
 $ nordvpn connect

# To add entries to kernel line, add them in the options line of the following file
  /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

# Connect with PIA!
  Two ways, but first, you need to make the file accessible to openvpn.  
  Look in /home/chris/PIA and get the one you want, copy it into /etc/openvpn/client
	but REPLACE the SPACES with UNDERSCORES, and the extension with .conf:
	'US Seattle.ovpn' => US_Seattle.conf
 
  The quick way: at this point you can run
    $ openvpn /etc/openvpn/client/US_Seattle.conf
  and it'll accept your credentials (look em up in your FF 1PasswordX extension).

  The better way: look in the .conf file for the user-auth-pass line, and add PIALogin.txt after it.
  PIALogin.txt has two lines, 1 being your PIA username, 2 being you password.
  Make sure to run `chmod 600` on it, or look in your logs for a warning: 
    > WARNING: file 'PIALogin.txt' is group or others accessible
  Now you can run:
    $ systemctl start openvpn-client@US_Seattle.service

# Connect the mouse
  Check to make sure bluetooth is running:\
  $ systemctl status bluetooth
  May need to restart it
  $ systemctl restart bluetooth

  IF that doesn't work, reconnect with bluetoothctl:
  $ bluetoothctl
    > paired-devices # list the paired devies, it's probably there
    > remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX # remove it
    > power off  # power off the bt controller
    > power on   # power it on
    > scan on # wait til you can see the mouse you're looking for
    > trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    > pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
    > connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Lock screen
  Mod (alt) + Ctrl + l (as in Lock)
  Find the binding in the ~/.config/i3/config file
  Basically it just runs `bindsym <KEYBOARD_SHORTCUT> exec <PATH_TO_I3LOCK_SOLARIZED>/bin/i3lock-solarized-<STYLE>.sh`
