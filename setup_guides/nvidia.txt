1. Following https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_P1

   - Section "Hybrid graphics with bbswitch only"
   - this requires manual switching between discrete and integrated graphics mode.

2. Install the appropriate NVIDIA graphics drivers (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA)
   - Found that `nvidia` is the right one
   - Make sure to see the mkinitcpio section: add the module and regenerate!
   - Installed the pacman hook from this page at /etc/pacman.d/hooks/nvidia.hook
